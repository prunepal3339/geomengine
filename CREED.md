## Welcome !!!
to the Geometry Engine – an open source Rust-based project aiming to bring precision, performance, and clarity to geometric computations.

This document lays down the creed that guides us to get into the right direction. These are not hard rules, but shared principles we strive to uphold as a community of respectful, thoughtful, and technically sound developers.

### ✨ DEVELOPERS - BELIEVE YOURSELVES
#### AI Creed
  * I will leverage AI tools, not blindly, but responsibly.
  * I will use AI to assist and augment my work, but I remain the final reviewer and decision-maker.

#### Testing & Documentation Creed
  * I will write tests as needed by the project and its direction.
  * I will write clear documentation comment for the functionalities built.
  * I will provide examples for the functionalities built.
  * I will document the why, not just the how.
#### Collaboration Creed
  * I will first check whether a similar issue has been raised before raising an issue.
  * I will respect the project maintainers' decision not to integrate my pull request if it diverges with project's goal.
  * I will not involve in any sort of arguments, collaborate with pride and respect all the communities around the globe.

#### Coding Philosophy Creed
  * I will prefer clarity over cleverness in code.
  * I will optimize only when needed, and never at the cost of safety without justification.
  * Performance is important, but correctness and clarity come first.


##### Thank You !!!
