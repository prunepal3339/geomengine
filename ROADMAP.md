# Geometry Engine Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for the Geometry Engine, a Rust-based library for 2D and 3D geometric computations. The roadmap is divided into **phases**, each with specific goals and deliverables. Future extensions are also listed to guide long-term development.

## Phase 1: 2D Core Primitives and Algorithms

### Goal
Implement foundational 2D geometric primitives and algorithms to enable basic 2D use cases.

### Deliverables
- **Primitives**:
  - `Point2D`: Represent 2D points.
  - `Line2D`: Represent 2D lines.
- **Algorithms**:
  - Distance calculations (point-to-point, point-to-line).
  - Intersection detection (line-line).
  - Basic transformations (translation, rotation, scaling).
  - Vector operations (dot product, normalization).
- **Testing**:
  - Unit tests for all primitives and algorithms.
- **Examples**:
  - Basic 2D geometric computations (e.g., distance between points, intersection of lines).

## Phase 4: Documentation and Release

### Goal
Make the library accessible and easy to use for developers.

### Deliverables
- **Documentation**:
  - Generate comprehensive API documentation using `cargo doc`.
  - Write step-by-step tutorials for common use cases (e.g., 2D/3D transformations, collision detection).
  - Provide code examples for all major features.
- **Release**:
  - Publish the library on `crates.io`.
  - Announce the release to the Rust community.

## Future Extensions

### Goal
Expand the library's capabilities based on user feedback and emerging needs.

### Planned Features
1. **Curves and Splines**:
   - Add support for ellipses, hyperbolas, and BÃ©zier curves.
2. **Serialization/Deserialization**:
   - Add support for serializing/deserializing geometric primitives (e.g., JSON, binary formats).
3. **GPU Acceleration**:
   - Use `wgpu` or `vulkano` to enable GPU-accelerated computations.
4. **Advanced Algorithms**:
   - Mesh generation.
   - Boolean operations (e.g., union, intersection, difference).
   - Advanced spatial queries (e.g., ray tracing, nearest neighbor search).
